Finds prime numbers
I have devised of 2 different algorithms to find prime numbers.
* 'prime.py' contains my initial algorithm (slowest)
* 'prime2.py' and 'primeCPP.cpp' contain my second algorithm (2nd fastest)
* 'prime3.py' contains the best algorithm I thought of without opening and reading files (fastest)

Speed of each algorithm (for finding all primes from 1 to 100,000):
* 'prime1.py': 45.5490000248 seconds
* 'prime2.py': 12.3789999485 seconds
* 'prime3.py': 2.39300012589 seconds
