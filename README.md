Finds prime numbers
I have devised of 2 different algorithms to find prime numbers.
* 'prime.py' contains my initial algorithm (slowest)
* 'prime2.py' and 'primeCPP' contain my second algorithm (2nd fastest)
* 'prime3.py' contains the best algorithm I thought of without opening and reading files (fastest)
