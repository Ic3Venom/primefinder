Finds prime numbers
I have devised of 2 different algorithms to find prime numbers.
* 'prime.py' contains my initial algorithm (slowest)
* 'prime2.py' and 'primeCPP.cpp' contain my second algorithm (2nd fastest)
* 'prime3.py' contains the best algorithm I thought of without opening and reading files (fastest)

Speed of each algorithm (for finding all primes from 1 to 100,000):
* 'Prime1.py': 50.0920000076 seconds
* 'Prime2.py': 14.3220000267 seconds
* 'Prime3.py': 2.84400010109 seconds
* 'Prime4.py': 27.7479999065 seconds
* 'Prime5.py': 2.56399989128 seconds
